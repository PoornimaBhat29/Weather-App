# Weather-App  - 5-Day Forecast

# Description  
This is a simple weather app that allows you to get the current weather and a 5-day weather forecast for any city.  
You simply need to input the city's name, and it will display:  
- Current temperature, humidity, and weather description.  
- A 5-day forecast with temperature and weather conditions.  

The weather data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API, so we need an API key to access the data.
